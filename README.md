# FlipItNLP-Cast-study
FlipItNews,, is on a mission to revolutionize financial literacy in India through AI and machine learning. By enhancing financial awareness with smart content discovery, FlipItNews aims to simplify business, finance, and investment for millennials and first-time investors.

<b>Objective</b>
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that categorizes news articles into predefined categories: politics, technology, sports, business, and entertainment. Using natural language processing (NLP), this project will automate the classification of articles from FlipItNews’s internal database, aiding in better content organization and discovery.

<b>Approach</b>
<ul>
<li>Data Collection and Preprocessing: Collect and clean a dataset of news articles from the company’s internal database.
Feature Extraction: Apply NLP techniques to transform text data into numerical features, including tokenization, lemmatization, and vectorization (e.g., TF-IDF, word embeddings).</li>
</ul>
</ul>Model Development: Train and evaluate the following models:</li>
<li>Naive Bayes: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem.</li>
<li>Random Forest: An ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and merges their results.</li>
<li>Decision Tree: A model that uses a tree-like graph of decisions to classify data.</li>
<li>LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): A type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) used for capturing long-term dependencies in text data.
Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of each model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to identify the most effective approach for categorizing news articles.</li>
</ul>
